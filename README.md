# Recommendation Modal

This project aims to develop a multi-modal movie recommendation system that leverages both textual and visual data to provide personalized movie recommendations. The system integrates BERT for textual data processing and ResNet50 for visual feature extraction, enabling it to handle diverse input modalities for enhanced recommendation accuracy.

Dataset:

The IMDB dataset serves as the primary source of movie data, providing metadata such as movie titles, descriptions, genres, cast, and crew, as well as movie posters.
Each movie in the dataset has:
Textual Features: Plot summaries, reviews, and genre labels.
Visual Features: Movie poster images.
Textual Feature Extraction with BERT:

The BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model is used to extract semantic embeddings from textual data.
Inputs to BERT:
Plot summaries or reviews to capture the thematic essence of the movie.
Tokenized and processed text data to generate contextual embeddings.
Output: High-dimensional textual embeddings that represent the movie's content meaningfully.
Visual Feature Extraction with ResNet50:

The ResNet50 convolutional neural network is employed to extract deep visual features from movie posters.
Pretrained on ImageNet, ResNet50 captures key visual attributes such as color schemes, artistic styles, and dominant elements of the poster.
Output: Visual embeddings that encode the movie's aesthetic and genre-related information.
Fusion of Textual and Visual Modalities:

The textual embeddings from BERT and the visual embeddings from ResNet50 are concatenated or combined using advanced techniques (e.g., attention mechanisms) to form a unified representation of each movie.
This multi-modal representation captures both semantic and visual information, improving recommendation quality.
Recommendation Engine:

A deep learning-based collaborative filtering or content-based filtering model is built using the multi-modal representations.
Similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity) or neural architectures (e.g., Multi-Layer Perceptrons) are applied to match user preferences with movie representations.
Training and Evaluation:

Training:
The system is trained using user-movie interaction data (e.g., ratings, watch history) to learn user preferences.
Loss functions such as triplet loss or cross-entropy loss are used to optimize recommendations.
Evaluation:
Performance is evaluated using metrics like precision@k, recall@k, NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain), and hit rate.
System Workflow:

Input: User preferences, such as watched movies, ratings, or favorite genres.
Processing:
BERT processes the plot summaries and user reviews.
ResNet50 extracts features from movie posters.
A fusion layer combines these features into a single multi-modal representation.
Output: A ranked list of recommended movies.
Advantages
Multi-Modality: Combines textual and visual information, leading to richer representations and more accurate recommendations.
Context-Aware Recommendations: BERT provides context-aware embeddings, ensuring that nuanced relationships in the textual data are captured.
Enhanced User Experience: The visual modality (posters) captures user attention and improves the relevance of recommendations.
